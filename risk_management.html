<h4><strong>6. Risk Documentation</strong></h4>

<p>A detailed risk register will be maintained, documenting each identified risk, its description, probability, impact, likely cause, mitigation strategy, and responsible team member. This documentation will serve as a reference for all stakeholders to ensure accountability and transparency.</p>

<hr />

<h4><strong>7. Regular Reviews</strong></h4>

<ul>
<li>Conduct weekly project status meetings to review the risk management plan.</li>
<li>Schedule quarterly updates to assess changes in project scope or external factors affecting risks.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4><strong>8. Impact Tracking</strong></h4>

<p>After implementing mitigation strategies, monitor their effectiveness through user feedback, performance metrics, and stakeholder reviews. For example:
- Track improvements in user satisfaction post-beta testing.
- Measure the impact of feedback integration on app functionality and UX.</p>

<hr />

<h4><strong>9. Dependency Consideration</strong></h4>

<p>Analyze interconnections among risks to ensure comprehensive management. For instance:
- If technical delays are likely, they may indirectly affect user feedback during beta testing.
- Monitor for potential cascading effects between risks (e.g., competition increasing market saturation).</p>

<hr />

<h4><strong>10. External Influences</strong></h4>

<p>Engage external experts in risk assessment and mitigation planning to address unpredictable factors like:
- Market changes affecting bike-sharing adoption rates.
- Regulatory shifts impacting the project timeline.</p>
